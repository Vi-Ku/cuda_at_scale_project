# Project Results: Signal Denoising at Scale

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates high-throughput signal processing using CUDA. The application generates synthetic noisy signal data (sine waves + random noise) and applies a **1D Moving Average Filter** on the GPU to smooth the data. The implementation is designed to handle varying scales of data, from small test cases to massive datasets .

## Performance Metrics
The application was executed on three different dataset sizes to demonstrate scalability.

| Scale | Elements | Window Size | Execution Time (GPU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small** | 10,000 | 3 | **[FILL IN TIME]** ms |
| **Medium** | 1,000,000 | 5 | **[FILL IN TIME]** ms |
| **Large** | 50,000,000 | 10 | **[FILL IN TIME]** ms |

*Note: Execution times include kernel computation only. Memory transfer overhead is excluded from this specific metric.*

## Proof of Execution (Visuals)

Below are the visualizations generated by the `plot_results.py` script, demonstrating the noise reduction capabilities of the CUDA kernel.

### 2. Medium Scale Test (1 Million Elements)
This demonstrates the kernel functioning correctly on a larger, denser dataset.

## Implementation Details
* **Algorithm:** 1D Moving Average Convolution .
* **Memory Management:** Unified `cudaMalloc` and `cudaMemcpy` for efficient host-device transfer.
* **Kernel Configuration:** Dynamic grid sizing based on input size `(N + threads - 1) / threads`.
* **Verification:** Output CSVs are cross-referenced with Python visualization tools to ensure signal integrity.
